    "Unfortunately, optimization of GP hyper-parameters is not always without problems. The likelihood surface that is being maximized is often flat and multi-modal, and thus the optimizer can sometimes fail to converge, or gets stuck in local-maxima. You can see from the optimization output above, that the gradients at the optima are very small ($10^{-18}$), but not necessarily zero. This kind of problem is due to the use of numerical optimization. When using GPs this can type of problem is common, and so we must always sanity check our answers, and ideally run some diagnostic tests on the fitted model.\n",
