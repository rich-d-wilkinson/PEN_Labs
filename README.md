# GPy tutorials

In June 2017 I organised a three day workshop on emulation. Alan Saul and I wrote three lab sessions to introduce the delegates to [GPy](https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy) that may be of use to others.
In particular, Lab 3 includes a very basic implementation of a PCA emulator, which is then used to do a simple history match for the UVic climate model.
